# SearchScriptScenePlugin
This plugin for the Godot game engine (3.2.X) enables you to search (case-insensitive) the open scenes and scripts to quickly switch to them.

Starting the search-string with \"c \" (for code) searches the open scripts.
Using  \"s \" (for scene) only goes through the open scenes.

Reopen the project after activating the plugin the first time it is activated.
