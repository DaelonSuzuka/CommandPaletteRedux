# SearchScriptScenePlugin
This plugin for the Godot game engine (3.2.X) adds a global keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+E) to access a list of all open scripts and scenes which can be filtered by a search_string.

Starting the search-string with \"c \" (for code) searches the open scripts.
Using  \"s \" (for scene) only goes through the open scenes.

Reopen the project after activating the plugin the first time it is activated.
