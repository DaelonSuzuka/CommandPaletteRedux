Opening a script will switch to the scene tab the script is attached to. It only works, if the script is attached to the scene root. This will give you autocompletion on Node(Path)s and their methods.

Selecting the file path will jump to the file in the filesystem dock.

While the popup is visible, pressing the shortcut again will switch to the last file opened with this plugin. The two labels at the bottom show the current and the last file opened with this plugin. Scene files (.tscn) should have the same name as the scene root (which is the default setting in Godot).

Pressing the copy button while a file name is selected, will copy the path to the file to the clipboard. If a code snippet is selected, the snippet will be copied to the clipboard.

Some export vars are available. Reopen the project after changing those or other things in the inspector of this plugin.
